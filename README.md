# Smart-Autonomous-Shopping-Mart-using-Node-red
Imagine going to a shopping mart, having to move around a trolley among a bunch of people,
going through each aisle and putting down all the essentials that you need. The thought of
COVID enters your mind and you realize how many people must have touched the trolley
handle. Not just that but even the items that you are picking out must have the bacterias all over
them. After you are done shopping, you get to the checkout counter, only to see a long lane of
people, practicing no social distancing.
The idea of our project is to design a new way to shop. The customers will enter the mart, scan
the barcodes of the products that they would need in order to add it to the online shopping cart,
confirm that they want to end their shopping and finally receive their order from the checkout.
